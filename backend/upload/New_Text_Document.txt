I am Luca, and I have worked for 10 years in various companies as a Frontend & Blockchain developer in the IT field.
Due to a health condition, I am unable to go to work.
My illness requires me to never move.
I am under constant care from my wife, who ensures that I remain immobile as part of my treatment.
However, I got permission from my wife to use the computer.
I am the type of person who can't live without working.
I wanted to continue working at the company, but the company told me to take good care of my illness and continue working after I recovered.

So, after lying down for a few days, I heard about upwork, freelancer.
After that, my account, which I was earning money by working with upwork, freelancer,
was suspended due to the bad behavior of the client, and I tried to create it again, but failed.

So I am looking for someone who can lend me an upwork, freelancer account.
You don't have to do anything.
Just create an account.
Then I will give you 10% of my income. If you knew the income of IT Senior Developer, I believe you would accept my offer unconditionally. Please contact me anytime.
Thanks.
Luca

Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out with an opportunity that may interest you. 

I have extensive experience on Upwork and am currently looking for someone who would be willing to rent out their account. I believe I can significantly grow the account’s revenue, potentially reaching $5,000 per month within six months.

In exchange for renting the account, I would be happy to share 15% of the monthly profits. If you’re able to assist with client calls, this percentage could increase to 20%. 

I'm particularly seeking accounts based in the US or UK, as I find they align best with my goals. If this sounds interesting to you, I would love to discuss it further! 

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.
